##Warning!

**This is currently a work in progress. No CLI are currently available. Feel free to play with this code using the `migrate.py` file and change settings in `config.py`. Only Bitbucket to Github works.**

###Features

* Migrates Issues and Comments from Bitbucket to Github and from Github to Bitbucket. (**Warning:** for now, only Bitbucket to Github is implemented, but all is designed to make it happen â€“ feel free to fork and pull request if you're inspired :) )
* Bitbucket *priority*, *kind* and *component* are converted to Github labels
* Context infos are added to *Issues* and *Comments*

###Install

Install dependencies with pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt `

###Usage

####Get a Github Authentication Token

Run the following command - username needs write access on
the Github repo specified above.

```
curl -u 'username' -d '{"scopes":["repo"],"note":"Migration"}' \
	https://api.github.com/authorizations
```

Just replace `username` by your username, `repo` shouldn't be replaced.

###Todo

* Implement a CLI
* Implement to Bitbucket migration
* Do not transform Bitbucket priority and kind to labels
* Create specific colors for Github labels depending on priority
